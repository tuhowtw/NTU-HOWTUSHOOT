# HOWTUSHOOT-NTU
A 2D Shooter Game made by TU HOW（涂皓）.
The showcase paper in Mandarin is avalible on my [Notion Page](http://bit.ly/howtureport).

A project using SFML library for Sprite drawing and Collision Detection, and the help from [sfml-vscode-boilerplate](https://github.com/andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate ) to make SFML functional in vscode.
To run the game, please install the corresponding SFML library to your compiler( you can refer to the link above). I have the gcc version working on my machine!
